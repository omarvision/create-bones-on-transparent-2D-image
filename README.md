# create-bones-on-transparent-2D-image
Animate 2D images in Unity with the 2d Animation package. Here I'll use Unity 2021.1 and the sprite editor to create bones on a picture of the pink panther. The sprite editor will also add geometry  (mesh outline of the 2D image) and weight (effect of each bone on the nearby geometry). The geometry and the weight have automatic features. After the bones are added to the sprite asset, drag and drop the sprite into the scene. Add a 2D Animation, Sprite Skin component and click the button create bones, so the component can detect all the bones you added in the sprite editor. Then when you move the bones the sprite beneath it moves. You can now animate it.
